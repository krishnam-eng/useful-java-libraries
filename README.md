# useful-java-libraries

Daily katas using popular and widely used Java libraries (both native & third-party)

Katas can be in the form of  
  - Programming Idioms
  - Drop-in Recipes
  - Trying out solution w/ or w/o lib (know what you are getting)
  - Just fun coding while exploring new things

Inspiration: The importance of the kata is well explained in Clean Coder Books

A kata, or code kata, is defined as an exercise (practice and repetition) in programming

- "Build & Sustain coding muscle for enterprise grade programming"
